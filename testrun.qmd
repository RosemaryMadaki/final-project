## Background

This is a brief report on a research conducted on assessing the relationship between salt consumption and blood pressure. This data was graciously donated by the Department of Biostatistics, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria.

## Results

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false

2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
2+5
```
